🚨 SafeHer AI – AI-Powered Women Safety Assistant

Overview:

SafeHer AI is an AI-powered women safety platform designed to provide quick assistance during emergency situations. The application combines artificial intelligence, location services, and emergency response features to enhance personal safety and support.

Built as part of the Build-A-Thon, SafeHer AI aims to create a safer environment by enabling instant SOS alerts, AI-based distress detection, live location tracking, and nearby help center discovery.

Problem Statement

Women often face safety concerns while traveling alone, especially during late hours or in unfamiliar locations. In emergency situations:

* Immediate access to help may not be available.
* Emergency contacts may not know the user's location.
* Panic situations make communication difficult.
* Finding nearby hospitals or police stations can be challenging.

SafeHer AI addresses these challenges through intelligent assistance and rapid response features.


Proposed Solution

SafeHer AI provides:
🚨 One-Tap Emergency SOS
🤖 AI-Based Distress Detection
📍 Live Location Tracking
🏥 Nearby Hospitals Finder
👮 Nearby Police Station Finder
📊 Safety Monitoring Dashboard
⚡ Real-Time Emergency Assistance

✨ Features
🚨 Emergency SOS Alert
Users can instantly trigger an emergency alert through a dedicated SOS button.

🤖 AI Distress Detection
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to analyze user messages and identify potential distress situations.
Examples:

| Input Message           | Result          |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Help me                 | HIGH RISK ALERT |
| Someone is following me | HIGH RISK ALERT |
| Good morning            | SAFE            |
| Thank you               | SAFE            |

📍 Live Location Sharing
Uses browser geolocation APIs to capture and display the user's current coordinates.

🏥 Nearby Help Centers
Finds nearby:
* Hospitals
* Police Stations
* Emergency Services
using OpenStreetMap and Overpass APIs.

📊 Safety Dashboard
Provides a centralized interface for:
* Emergency Actions
* AI Risk Detection
* Location Tracking
* Safety Information

🧠 AI Model Details
The distress detection model is trained using:
* CountVectorizer
* Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier

Workflow:
1. User enters a message.
2. Text is converted into numerical vectors.
3. AI model analyzes the message.
4. Risk level is predicted.
5. Alert is displayed.
